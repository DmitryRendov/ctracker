  <i>CTracker</i> was created as an add-on to track changes in Google spreadsheets 
  and notify an owner about all changes.
  </p>
  <p>
  The number of notifications this add-on produces are limited by the owner's
  available email quota; it will not send email notifications if the owner's
  daily email quota has been exceeded. Collaborators using this add-on on the
  same sheet will be able to adjust the notification settings, but will not be
  able to disable the notification triggers set by other collaborators.
